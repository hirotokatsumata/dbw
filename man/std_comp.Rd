\title{Generates standardized complete cases}
\usage{
std_comp(
  formula_y,
  formula_ps,
  estimand = "ATE",
  method_y = "wls",
  data,
  std = TRUE,
  weights = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula_y}{an object of class \code{\link[stats]{formula}} (or one that
can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the potential
outcome model to be fitted. When you want to use non-DR type estimators,
only include "1" in the right hand side of the formula for the Hajek
estimator and only include "0" for the Horvitz-Thompson estimator.
See example of \code{\link{dbw}} for more details.}

\item{formula_ps}{an object of class \code{\link[stats]{formula}} (or one that
can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the propensity score
model to be fitted. For the entropy balancing weighting (\code{method = "eb"}),
variables in the right hand side of the formula will be mean balanced.}

\item{estimand}{a character string specifying a parameter of interest. Choose
"ATT" for the average treatment effects on the treated estimation, "ATE"
for the average treatment effects estimation, "ATC" for the average
outcomes estimation in missing outcome cases. You can choose "ATEcombined"
for the combined estimation for the average treatment effects estimation
when using the covariate balancing weighting (\code{method = "cb"}).}

\item{method_y}{a character string specifying a method for potential outcome
prediction. Choose "wls" for the linear model, "logit" for the logistic
regression, "gam" for the generalized additive model for the continuous
outcome, and "gambinom" for the generalized additive model for the binary
outcome.}

\item{data}{a data frame (or one that can be coerced to that class)
containing the outcomes and the variables in the model.}

\item{std}{a logical parameter indicating whether to standardize the
covariates for propensity score estimation.}

\item{weights}{an optional vector of ‘prior weights’ (e.g. sampling weights)
to be used in the fitting process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector.}
}
\value{
\item{data}{the complete-case data frame containing the outcome variable,
the response (treatment) variable, and the standardized covariates for
propensity score estimation.}
\item{weights}{the initially-supplied weights for the complete cases, a
vector of 1s if none were.}
\item{formula_ps}{the automatically-created formula for propensity score
estimation, which includes expanded factors and interactions.}
\item{mean_x}{the weighted mean of each covariates.}
\item{sd_x}{the weighted standard deviation of each covariates.}
}
\description{
Standardizes covariates for propensity score estimation before the
distribution balancing weighting \code{\link{dbw}} with the regularization.
}
\details{
\code{std_comp} first extracts complete cases for both propensity score estimation
and outcome model estimation. Then it standardizes covariates for propensity
score estimation by takeing the provided weights into account. The returned
data frame is the "design matrix", which contains a set of dummy variables
(depending on the contrasts) for factors and similarly expanded interaction
terms.

For the AO estimation, NA values for the outcome variable for missing cases
(the response variable taking "0") are not deleted. For this processing, the
outcome variable name must not contain spaces.

Description: Implements the doubly robust distribution balancing weighting 
    proposed by Katsumata (2023), which improves the augmented inverse 
    probability weighting (AIPW) by estimating propensity scores with estimating 
    equations suitable for the pre-specified parameter of interest (e.g., the 
    average treatment effects or the average treatment effects on the treated) 
    and estimating outcome models with the estimated inverse probability weights.
    It also implements the covariate balancing propensity score proposed by Imai 
    and Ratkovic (2014) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12027> and the entropy balancing 
    weighting proposed by Hainmueller (2012) <doi:10.1093/pan/mpr025>, which use 
    covariate balancing conditions in propensity score estimation. The point 
    estimate of the parameter of interest and its uncertainty as well as 
    coefficients for propensity score estimation and outcome regression are 
    produced using the M-estimation. The same functions can be used to estimate 
    average outcomes in missing outcome cases.
